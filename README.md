# HDB CGI
This is the codebase for the CGI program that enables read-only online access to time-series data contained within Reclamation Hydrologic Databases (HDB). The compiled program and accompanying file package provides several data services once deployed on a web server. This program uses [DevArt](https://www.devart.com/) components to connect to HDB instances.
